Project Overview

This project implements a real-time neural style transfer application using TensorFlow. Neural style transfer (NST) involves reimagining an image by applying the artistic style of another image (e.g., turning a photo into the style of a famous painting). This implementation uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network to achieve the effect efficiently in real-time.

Key Features

Real-Time Processing: Optimized for fast execution using TensorFlow and GPU acceleration.

Pre-trained Models: Utilizes pre-trained VGG19 for feature extraction and style representation.
